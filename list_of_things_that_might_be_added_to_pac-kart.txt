random things im thinking of adding to pac-kart to make it less bad

not everything here will be added probably
some things may not be added because i am bad or because they are a bad idea
--------------------------------
pac-kart:

code base:
    delete testing functions in static_spider.js that dont need to be there

    add comments to the beginning of some functions showing what parameter type there are
        or maybe just rename things better

    split array_viewer functions away from the index sections

    combine html_to_info/html_to_edit?

    move the html_to function to file testing

info_ handle switch cases,
    have ability to create select box from switch if possible
    handle multi type like bmg_demo_extended_world_link
    handle amount array and type like bmg_mysterious_4t5
    handle sections like bmg_some_model_anim_36_4 ???
    handle sections where amount somewhere else like bmg_world_28_80 ???

info_ types idea
    0 = default // type and offset are already in most key names
    "texture_patch" // is this needed?
    "animation_patch" // is this needed?
    "sound_patch" // is this needed?
    "model_patch" // is this needed?
    {} // object indicates unique values?
    {
    a // amount, number points to section if not null
    d // value is disabled if true
    n // non default key name if string
    o // non default offset if value
    t // non default type if string
    s // switch case if not null, another object?
        {
        offset_format_type // usually u32, string
        offset_type_target // where type is located, sometimes not in same section
        offset_amount // uint value of amount, rare
        }
    c // color, this should probably only be for u32
        {
        red
        green
        blue
        alpha
        // this will split the u32 into 4 inputs, include 1 color box on the end
        }
    }

have some way to edit add_ sections

array_viewer ideas:
    have the file_viewer display the path instead of a file view

    have it look something like this
    x
    [0]
    .directory
    [3]
    .datapack
    [0]
    .ordered
    [0]
    .file_specific
    [0]
    .basic_04
    [0]

    clicking any of the lines will take you to that section
    maybe have a toggle between them somewhere
    maybe have a version showing history of sections clicked
        have history arrows at the bottom of either the file viewer or file editor?

    also have path in file editor section at the top would look like
    Path: x[0].directory[3].datapack[0].ordered[0].file_specific[0].basic_04[0]

    in an array entry with multiple other entries on either side
        maybe have an arrow above / below somewhere in the file editor section
            so able to loop/move between besides file viewer

    have the ability to add a new file without importing
    maybe rename new file to import file
    and have it be like | create file | import file | save
    when clicking create file will have to select the game->version same as when unknown version imported
    save file would probably be selectable here as well

    display somewhere on the screen how long it takes to load the file
    have it dissapear after like 5 secs with an anim
    also have one for when a file is exported

    remove show extra information
    this isnt really being used for anything important probably

    maybe have the ability to load multiple .x* files at the same time
    this might be usuful for shared files
    when saving might just add to .zip file or smthn

    unlink some files from the html array_viewer file

have a settings section above the x array
settings like:
reduce padding checkbox
    removes padding from the ordered list mostly
    not sure if any padding in that is actually used/needed for anything
    also not sure if end of file is used for anything either
convert file version to another type/console
    conversion probably just for console versions
    converting different game versions is probably not possible without a lot of information being lost
zip file name?

have some way to import / export sections to json
    not sure how to handle buffers in this

in the array view, have some way to multi edit sections
    section would probably be under the list of arrays
    would have each object entry listed
    would be able to click a select input and change values,
    something like [object entry | selection box | input box(es) | save button]
    select box would like:
        equeals = set all array values for this object entry to this
        change value based on, would use 3 input boxes
            1 input box for the base value
            2 selection box, increment/decrement value by fixed amount or spread amount based on 3rd box
                if spread amount and 5 arrays and input 1 is 0 and input 3 is 100, values would be like [0,25,50,75,100]
            3 input final box, based on 2

make a collision editor (this will never happen sad)

add a changelog somewhere

add version number
    v1 should prob be when all files are extractable
    maybe add version number in title/ bottom right side
        version could link to changelog
            should open in new link

add ability to change css colors, probably on file settings section

add a pseudo console on top, will show last command ran or smthn

add import/export tables for:
bcc
bmg
bmg_demo
ect
--------------------------------
ideas for pac-kart documentation:
move the format for pac man world rally to its own file
    also move the pmwr save file as well
    PMR save file not listed

update padding list

based on type number entries supposed to be inside anchor tag

maybe create sha1 file list for each version mayb

list if offset is 'up' or 'down' based on general offset list patch list

bcc
    update linked sections
    verify bcc offsets
    probably need to rename some sections
    add structure box

bmg
    add patch list  list of links
    research bmg audio missing sections
    also rename some sections based on demo version
    add structure box

pmwr_ps2demo
    pmwr_ps2demo or pmwr_ps2_demo or pmwr_demo ?
    add structure box
    probably need to rename some sections

pmwr_xdx
    add structure box

svtrb
    add structure box

hwvx
    some linked to by: sections missing entries
    reorder some unordered sections

hwvx_proto
    should append _proto to the section names
    move sections
    maybe show psuedo code here

mmvcl
    some sections dont have mm listed
    add patch list  list of links
    should this be mm or mmvcl?
--------------------------------
ideas for pac-kart filetesting:

reserch other save files?

make auto float list have a maxlength for string

have better way to generate tables with the html_to sections

remove extra new lines from <hr/> above <h2> tags
also remove empty space between </a> </td> tags

bcc
    does bcc_world actually have a sound at offset 0 or is patch list misaligned
        think its probably misaligned
    reorder functions based on docs
    research audio missing sections

bmg
    rename some sections based on demo version
    research audio missing sections
    research how world list is layed out
    reorder functions based on docs

pmwr_ps2demo
    research how world list is layed out
    reorder functions based on docs

pmwr_xdx
    research how world list is layed out
    reorder functions based on docs

pmwr
    current version is just copied from xbox mostly so wrong format

svtrb
    research how world list is layed out
    reorder functions based on docs

hwvx
    some linked to by: sections missing entries

hwvx_proto
    research how world list is layed out
    reorder functions based on docs

mmvcl
    add the abbility to search the Patch List for Motor Mayhem: Vehicular Combat League
        and find lost offsets/patches
